# Overview
grid_pptx is a tool for quickly creating PowerPoint documents, especially those involving 
the presentation of data. grid_pptx builds on the venerable python-pptx with a more highly 
abstracted API for common tasks, a Bootstrap-inspired grid layout, and the ability to 
quickly create charts and tables from Pandas dataframes.
