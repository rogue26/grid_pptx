grid_pptx - Simplifying the PowerPoint creation process in Python
=================================================================

grid_pptx is a tool for quickly creating PowerPoint documents, especially those involving the presentation of data.
grid_pptx builds on the venerable python-pptx with a more highly abstracted API for common tasks, a Bootstrap-inspired
grid layout, and the ability to quickly create charts and tables from Pandas dataframes.
